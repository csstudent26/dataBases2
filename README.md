#dataBases2 Project
Description
The aim of the DataBases2 project is to build upon the concepts explored in DataBases1 and further expand the integration of databases with additional technologies such as Servlets and a local server (Tomcat). This project demonstrates the development of a database-driven application and showcases how various components synergize to create a robust and dynamic web application.

Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
Java
JDBC
MySQL
Servlets
Tomcat (local server)
Features
Enhanced functionality through the integration of Servlets for server-side processing.
Utilization of a local server (Tomcat) to host and deploy the application.
