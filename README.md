# DataBases2 Project

## Description
The aim of the DataBases2 project is to build upon the concepts explored in DataBases1 and further expand the integration of databases with additional technologies such as Servlets and a local server (Tomcat). This project demonstrates the development of a database-driven application and showcases how various components synergize to create a robust and dynamic web application.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Java
- JDBC
- MySQL
- Servlets
- Tomcat (local server)

## Features
- Enhanced functionality through the integration of Servlets for server-side processing.
- Utilization of a local server (Tomcat) to host and deploy the application.
- Extended database interactions to support advanced CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Improved user experience with dynamic content generation and interactivity.

## Getting Started
To get started with the DataBases2 project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

Replace `<repository URL>` with the actual URL of your DataBases2 project repository.

### 2. Set up the local server (Tomcat)
- Download and install Tomcat from the official website: [Tomcat Downloads](https://tomcat.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Configure Tomcat to run on your local machine.
- Deploy the DataBases2 project on the Tomcat server.

### 3. Set up the database
- Create a MySQL database to store the necessary data.
- Modify the database connection settings in the project's configuration files.

### 4. Build and run the project
- Compile the Java source files.
- Start the local server (Tomcat) and deploy the project.
- Access the application through a web browser.
