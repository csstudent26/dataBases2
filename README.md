# dataBases2  Project


## Description
The aim of the DataBases2 project is to build upon the concepts explored in DataBases1 and further expand the integration of databases with additional technologies such as Servlets and a local server (Tomcat). This project demonstrates the development of a database-driven application and showcases how various components synergize to create a robust and dynamic web application.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Java
- JDBC
- MySQL
- Servlets
- Tomcat (local server)

## Features
- Enhanced functionality through the integration of Servlets for server-side processing.
- Utilization of a local server (Tomcat) to host and deploy the application.
- Extended database interactions to support advanced CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Improved user experience with dynamic content generation and interactivity.
## General Notes

- The DataBases2 project is not a traditional Java project; it is a Dynamic Web Project. The IDE being used, such as Eclipse IDE, allows for the creation of such a project.
- The project uses Servlets, which means the Java code will be different from a standard Java project. For example, a main method is not used, and certain conditions must be observed when working with Servlets.
- It is necessary to have a local server installed on your system to run the project. In this case, Tomcat is being used.
- When creating the project, the IDE will provide a choice of servers, including Tomcat (assuming it has been downloaded and installed). A folder named 'Server Runtime [Apache Tomcat _ _]' will be automatically added to the project.
- In addition to the Tomcat server, a JDBC connection needs to be added to connect the program to the database. In my experience, the JDBC connector (a Java file) can be added to the 'Server Runtime' folder. Otherwise, you may encounter a 'no suitable driver found' error.
## Getting Started
To get started with the DataBases2 project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

Replace `<repository URL>` with the actual URL of your DataBases2 project repository.

### 2. Set up the local server (Tomcat)
- Download and install Tomcat from the official website: [Tomcat Downloads](https://tomcat.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Configure Tomcat to run on your local machine.
- Deploy the DataBases2 project on the Tomcat server.

### 3. Set up the database
- Create a MySQL database to store the necessary data.
- Modify the database connection settings in the project's configuration files.

### 4. Build and run the project
- Compile the Java source files.
- Start the local server (Tomcat) and deploy the project.
- Access the application through a web browser.
